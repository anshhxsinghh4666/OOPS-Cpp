OOPS in C++ – Learning Repository

This repository contains a curated collection of C++ programs created while learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS). 
It is designed as a reference for key OOPS concepts and showcases my understanding of C++ programming with a clean and modular approach.

📌 Overview

The repository covers the core principles of OOPS in C++:
	•	Classes & Objects – Basic structure and object creation.
	•	Constructors & Destructors – Default, parameterized, and copy constructors.
	•	Inheritance – Single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance.
	•	Polymorphism – Compile-time and runtime polymorphism (function overloading, operator overloading, virtual functions).
	•	Encapsulation & Abstraction – Data hiding and abstract classes.
	•	Friend Functions & Friend Classes – Access control and relationships between classes.
	•	Static Members & Functions – Class-wide properties and behavior.
	•	File Handling – Applying OOPS concepts with file I/O.

 🎯 Purpose
	•	Demonstrate strong foundational knowledge of OOPS in C++.
	•	Build a structured repository for future reference and portfolio showcasing.
	•	Apply version control best practices to track progress and code improvements.
